I'll help you revise this to sound more like it was written by a college student. Here's a more casual, less polished version:

# Deep Research AI Project
My multi-agent system for web research using LangGraph & LangChain (for my CS490 final)

## What This Does
I built this AI research tool that:
* Takes your questions and breaks them down
* Searches the web using Tavily's API
* Grabs content from relevant websites
* Puts everything together into a decent answer
* Double-checks itself for accuracy

## How It Works
I set up different agents to handle specific tasks:
* A coordinator agent that manages everything
* Research agents that gather info
* Content processors that make sense of web pages
* Answer generators that write up the findings
* QA agents that make sure the answers aren't garbage

## Setting It Up
You'll need:
* Python 3.8 or newer
* API keys for OpenAI and Tavily

### Installation Steps
1. Clone my repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-research-agent.git
cd deep-research-agent
```

2. Install the packages:
```
pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-openai langgraph python-dotenv
pip install langchain-community tavily-python langchain-text-splitters
pip install chromadb
```

3. Make a `.env` file with your keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

## How to Use It
Basic example:

```python
from deep_research import run_deep_research

# Ask something
result = run_deep_research("What are the environmental impacts of quantum computing?")

# See what you got
print(result)
```

Or make a file called `run.py`:

```python
from deep_research import run_deep_research

# Whatever you want to research
query = "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"

# Run it
result = run_deep_research(query)

# Check out the answer
print("\n\n=== RESEARCH RESULTS ===\n\n")
print(result)
```

Then just run:
```
python run.py
```

## What's Inside
1. Query Agent - breaks down your questions
2. Research Agents - search the web and grab content
3. Content Processing - figures out what's important
4. Answer Writing - puts everything together
5. Quality Check - makes sure it's not totally wrong

## Tweaking It
You can mess with the settings in `deep_research.py`:
* Change how many search results with `tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)`
* Use different LLMs with `research_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo", temperature=0.2)`
* Change how text gets chunked with `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`

## When Things Break
The system tries to handle common problems like:
* Search API timeouts
* Websites that won't load
* Incomplete information

## Future Improvements
I'm thinking about adding:
* Agents that can handle academic papers
* Different search options
* Custom setups for specific research types

## License
MIT License (basically do whatever you want with it)

## Credits
* Built this using LangChain and LangGraph
* Search powered by Tavily
* Used OpenAI's models for the smart stuff
